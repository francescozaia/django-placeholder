Django Placeholder image service
================================

The Placeholder image service from CHAPTER 2 of the book [Lightweight Django - Using REST, Websockets, and Backbone](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920032502.do) By Julia Elman, Mark Lavin

I just cleaned up the code to be in a more typical Django structure, maybe it can be useful to someone learning Django.
